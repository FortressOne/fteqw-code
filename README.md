# FortressOne FTEQW-CODE Fork

This repo serves three purposes:
1. As a backup / mirror of Spike's [FTE Quakeworld SVN repo](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fteqw/). 
2. To hold the FortressOne specific build configuration.
3. As a place to release FortressOne binaries.

For the real readme see README.txt

Building FTE can be a bit tricky, if docker is your thing try the [fte-compiler repo](https://github.com/FortressOne/fte-compiler).
